	<H3>What is the difference between the HTM and HTML extensions?</H3>

	<H4>Short Answer</H4>

	<P>
		Other than the obvious, the letter "L," there's not much of a
		difference between the two extensions.  Most, if not all, web
		browsers and servers will treat a file with an HTM extension
		exactly as it would a file with an HTML extension, and vice
		versa.
	</P>

	<H4>Long Answer</H4>

	<H5>Practical Differences</H5>

	<P>
		Practically speaking, there is no difference between the two
		extensions.  Both denote that the file contains HTML.  This
		is really a matter of convention and is not an absolute, but
		most realize that a file whose extension is <TT>htm</TT> <EM>or</EM>
		<TT>html</TT> contains HTML.
	</P>

	<P>
		On most, if not all, servers either file will be sent with a
		MIME type of text/html by default.  This can usually be
		changed by the server's administrator(s), but is, more often
		then not, left alone.
	</P>

	<P>
		On most, if not all, browsers, either file will be displayed
		as intended (i.e. rendered according to the browser's default
		manner of displaying HTML documents).  This last is due more
		to the MIME type sent by the server then by the file's
		extension, but that's a matter for another FAQ.
	</P>

	<P>
		Generally, the use of <TT>htm</TT> over <TT>html</TT>, or vice versa, is left
		to the author's personal preferences.
	</P>

	<H5>Technical Differences</H5>

	<P>
		Technically speaking there are few to no important differences.
		An obvious difference is the addition of the letter "L" in
		the <TT>html</TT> extension.  The technical difference that the
		additional letter will make to the operating system is
		better left to a different discussion but in the context of
		a web author, the additional "L" will make no difference.
	</P>

	<P>
		The technical difference that the additional letter will make
		to an http server (a "web server") is minimal.  Usually, a
		server will use a file's extension to figure out what MIME
		type to send back to the requesting client.  Most servers
		are configured by default to send back the text/html type
		when the requested file ends in an <TT>htm</TT> or <TT>html</TT> extension.
		This can be changed by the server's administrator(s) in such
		a way that one of the above extensions returns a different
		MIME type than the other, however, this is not a very common
		practice.
	</P>

	<P>
		It is a common misconception that a file ending in an <TT>htm</TT>
		extension had to have been created on a DOS/Windows 3.x
		platform.  This is because those operating environments
		limit filenames to a 3 letter extension.  However, it is very
		simple to create a file with a 3 letter extension on most
		other platforms, as well.  Even those that allow longer file
		extensions.
	</P>

	<H5>Default Filenames</H5>

	<P>
		The one situation in which there may be a difference between
		the two extensions is that of a server's default filenames.
		When a URL that does not specify a filename is requested from
		a server, such as <TT>http://www.domain.dom/dirname/</TT>,
		the server returns a file from the requested URL that matches
		a default filename.  Examples of common default filenames
		include "index.html," "index.htm," "welcome.html,"
		"welcome.htm," "default.html," "default.htm," etc.  However,
		an administrator can make the server's default filename
		anything he/she so desires.
	</P>

	<P>
		In the case of a default file, the author's filename must be
		exactly the same as the server's default filename.  In other
		words, if your server is configured to use "index.html" as
		the default filename, your file must be named "index.html"
		and <EM>not</EM> "index.htm."
	</P>

	<P>
		Note that servers are often configured with more then one
		default filename.  Check with your server administrator or
		ISP for details about your specific server.
